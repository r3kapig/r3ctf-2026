# ref.s -- REFERENCE SOLVE for Blinky (R3CTF): the USER-region submission
# (< 0x2000). The server splices the secret kernel (>= 0x2000, per-run PAC key)
# over this. Single run, no committed faults.
#
# The flag lives at VA 0x2030 (kernel), reachable only via a `jr` whose pointer
# carries the correct 8-bit PAC tag in bits [63:56]. The tag depends on a secret
# per-run key, so it must be recovered. Recover it from a D-cache SPECTRE side
# channel WITHOUT ever committing a bad-tag fault (the rate limiter would lock):
#   * A mispredicted attack branch runs a PAC-gated shadow LOAD on its speculative
#     wrong-path. A good tag fills the USER PROBE line (0x1000); a bad tag is
#     NO_LOAD and, drained as speculative, never faults.
#   * Time a reload of PROBE: hit (~2 cyc) => this guess is the tag; miss => wrong.
#   * Miss latency is noisy (I$/D$ arbiter beat), so VOTE: measure each guess
#     twice and accept only if BOTH are hits. A wrong guess drifts +53/iter and
#     cannot read < THRESH twice in a row -> zero false positives.
# On the recovered tag we authenticate ONE `jr {tag,0x2030}` -> the kernel prints
# the flag.
